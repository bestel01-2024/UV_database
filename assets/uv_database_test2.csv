The painting depicts a woman from the waist up, sitting at a desk and playing a clavichord. She wears a red dress, a headpiece, and an ornate necklace. On the desktop, next to the clavichord, sits a golden chalice, and there is another instrument leaning up against the wall in the background. The desk is covered in a green fabric.


This painting appears to be a copy of Lady playing a clavichord by The Master of the Female Half-Lengths dated to 1530. The Master of the Female Half Lengths is the name given to a 16th century painter or workshop of painters believed to be located in Antwerp. The name was given retroactively in the 19th century by Friedl√§nder to identify over 107 works of art mostly focused on women in courtly dress, participating in varying genre scenes. The Master of the Female Half-Lengths also painted religious and mythological narratives.
